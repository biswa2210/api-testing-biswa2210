## About API :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
 
An application programming interface (API) is a connection between computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software. A document or standard that describes how to build such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either to the specification or to the implementation. In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user) other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into software. An API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or implement them.

## About HEROKU :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
 
Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. For this reason, Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it has features for a developer to build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across most languages. Heroku was acquired by Salesforce.com in 2010 for $212 million. Heroku was initially developed by James Lindenbaum, Adam Wiggins, and Orion Henry for supporting projects that were compatible with the Ruby programming platform known as Rack. I have used HEROKU to host my api.

## About this project :point_down:

### LOCALHOST  :point_down:

<div align="justified">
 
I have made this API testing and run it in localhost where I defined the port number. So we can run this API in localhost through npm start. Using the API in localhost we can upload image files in updates folder in public folder using POST REQUEST. After that it will be uploaded in my 'daily-deals-images-bucket's storage in https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daily-deals-images-bucket/storage/daily-deals-images-bucket.appspot.com/files in my firebase acount associated with my email id 'bbiswa471@gmail.com'. If a user is 'ADMIN USER' he or she will be able to get details like user details. For this he or she has to use GET REQUEST.

### HEROKUAPP LINK :point_down:


<div align="justified">
 
I have made this API testing and hosted it in HEROKU. I have generated a link through HEROKU. Using the API in localhost we can upload image files in updates folder in public folder using POST REQUEST. After that it will be uploaded in my 'daily-deals-images-bucket's storage in https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daily-deals-images-bucket/storage/daily-deals-images-bucket.appspot.com/files in my firebase acount associated with my email id 'bbiswa471@gmail.com'.
