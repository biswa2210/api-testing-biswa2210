### LOCALHOST  :point_down:

<div align="justified">
 
I have made this API testing and run it in localhost where I defined the port number. So we can run this API in localhost through npm start. Using the API in localhost we can upload image files in uploads folder in public folder using POST REQUEST. After that it will be uploaded in my 'daily-deals-images-bucket's storage in https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daily-deals-images-bucket/storage/daily-deals-images-bucket.appspot.com/files in my firebase acount associated with my email id 'bbiswa471@gmail.com'. If a user is 'ADMIN USER' he or she will be able to get details like user details. For this he or she has to use GET REQUEST.

### HEROKUAPP LINK :point_down:

<div align="justified">
 
I have made this API testing and hosted it in HEROKU. I have generated a link through HEROKU. I have used POSTMAN application for POST and GET requests for this API where I have created a workspace and pasted the link. Using the API link we can upload image files in uploads folder in public folder in HEROKU app storage using POST REQUEST. After that it will be uploaded in my 'daily-deals-images-bucket's storage in https://console.firebase.google.com/project/daily-deals-images-bucket/storage/daily-deals-images-bucket.appspot.com/files in my firebase acount associated with my email id 'bbiswa471@gmail.com'. If a user is 'ADMIN USER' he or she will be able to get details like user details. For this he or she has to use GET REQUEST. HEROKU filesystem is ephemeral it means it automatically deletes the files from its storage after a span of time.
